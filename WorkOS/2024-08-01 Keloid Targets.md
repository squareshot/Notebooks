# Review of RGC-derived target list


- ==**_PHLDA3_**== 
- ==**DUSP10**==
  - Previously reported locus, which we replicate. Top hit is in an intergenic region ~350kb from DUSP10.
  - A 2023 paper (PMID: [36689521](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36689521/ "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36689521/")) proposes that the risk-increasing effect of rs1348270 Ref (Minor) GG allele is via downregulation of long non-coding RNA RP11-400N13.1 (DEIK) (not DUSP10 or LINC01705), thereby promoting keloid development by increasing expression of collagens and chondrocyte- and osteocyte-associated genes POSTN and COMP through upregulating BMP2 in keloid fibroblasts. An rs1348270-containing enhancer loops to the DEIK promoter and GG allele is associated with decreased enhancer-promoter interaction.
- ~~AP4E1~~
- ==**NEDD4**==
  - Previously reported locus, which we replicate. Below in bullets is some background info I had collated a couple of years back. We observed that the top SNP lies in a regulatory region containing promoter and proximal-enhancer signatures (including in dermal fibroblasts), right before the start of the shorter NEDD4 transcript, and this was consistent with reports of transcript-specific increased expression as listed below. Recently a new paper came out which explained this transcript-specific effect: the GWAS hit tags a LINE-1 insertion which acts as a transcript-specific enhancer of the short, pro-inflammatory NEDD4 transcript ([link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-023-01390-2 "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-023-01390-2")).
  - Founding member of the NEDD4 family of **ubiquitin ligases** that is evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes. Regulates a number of membrane receptors and endocytic machinery components, with many potential substrates identified (PMID: [25527121](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25527121 "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25527121")).
  - Controls growth by regulating **insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) signaling**. NEDD4 loss results in reduced IGF-1 signaling in mice, delayed embryonic development, growth reduction and fetal lethality (PMID: [18812566](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18812566 "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18812566")).
  - Catalyzes **PTEN polyubiquitylation and degradation** (PMID: [25527121](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25527121 "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25527121")).
  - _NEDD4_ locus has previously been **associated with keloid risk and severity** in BBJ (Japan) (PMID: [20711176](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20711176/ "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20711176/"), [24496234](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24496234/ "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24496234/")), and in Chinese Han (PMID: [23667473](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23667473 "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23667473")) and Egyptian populations (PMID: [32943899](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32943899 "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32943899")).
  - The rs8032158 risk allele C in keloid patients is associated with a selectively **higher expression of TV3 of NEDD4 to activate the NF-****κ****B pathway**. NEDD4 knockdown suppressed NF-κB-dependent inflammation development _in vivo_ (mouse model with imiquimod on ear) (PMID: [30273597](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30273597/ "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30273597/"); [30471838](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30471838/ "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30471838/")) .
  - Possible mechanism in **keloid formation** is through enhancement of the **proliferation and invasiveness of fibroblasts** as well as upregulation of **type 1 collagen expression** (PMID: [21986318](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21986318 "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21986318")).
  - **PTEN levels are significantly reduced** in keloid samples (P=0.05). **NEDD4-1 expression is high** and inversely correlated with that of PTEN in keloids. (PMID: [26535660](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26535660/ "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26535660/")).
  - _NEDD4_ locus is nominally associated with postburn scar height and pliability (PMID: [30595539](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30595539/ "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30595539/")).

- **==ITGA11==**
  - This review lists various publications on a11b1 integrin and also discusses the challenges and limitations of current animal models ([link](https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/129/4/653/55895/The-integrin-collagen-connection-a-glue-for-tissue "https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/129/4/653/55895/The-integrin-collagen-connection-a-glue-for-tissue")), including this paper which claims reduced wound strength in a KO mouse model but, as we were discussing, is not all too convincing ([link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X15372535 "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X15372535")).
- **GLIS3**

Nice paper utilizing both human and mouse tissues and cells, which identified circular RNA circGLIS3 produced from exon 2 of _GLIS3_. circGLIS3 is transiently upregulated in dermal fibroblasts after wounding (especially induced by IL-1a), where it promotes TGF-b signaling, fibroblast activation and ECM deposition. They also find that circGLIS3 is overexpressed in keloids ([link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.05.506337v1.full "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.05.506337v1.full")). Our GWAS hit in this locus is very close to exon 2. We’re excited to see how this locus will look with increased sample size.
