Brief Background

Late 2023, I met with Dr. Rhew after we heard a wide range of reports from children and parents corroborating our belief that Grace was bullying our kid.

Dr. Rhew stated that there are more than enough adults to keep an eye on these interactions, especially during the less structured parts of the day. This was all I expected, and all I would have asked for.

We were never contacted by the school, and do not know if there was appropriate follow-through on this conversation. 

More recently, Susannah (as you know) bullied Xil out of Burnham.
I met with Dr. Rhew on February 8th to discuss this matter, for several reasons:
1. This is kindergarten. No child should be scared out of one of your schoos by another student who has a long-established pattern of aggressive and absolutely unrestrained behavior towards others. 
2. Of the 3 other girls in Burnham kindergarten, Xil is the only one who has been consistently warm, kind, and a wonderful friend to our daughter since they met. With her gone, Laine is now left with the two have persistently violated the rules of conduct expected- required- in the public school system, conduct that is elaborated upon in the Burnham charter (which happens to be buried in someone’s Google Drive, and has clearly been made as difficult as possible to find and access).
3. We have a great deal of experience with Susannah- her family lives down the street- and that experience has been unequivocally horrifying. In our home, Sara and I could not stop her from punching and kicking our daughter, destroying property, refusing to listen, and worse. In our car- with Marty present- we could not stop Susannah from hitting Laine. I made it clear to Marty that this was unacceptable; she said nothing, and did nothing. Yet, she inisists Susannah isn’t a hitter, and spends all her time lying about the most fundamental aspects of these experiences to anyone she can get to listen.  

We can assure you that no teacher can adequately attend to a kindergarten class while simultaneously attempting to manage Susannah, and one helper is insufficient as a workaround.

We know Susannah is a hitter, and we know she is much more than that. In my conversation with Dr. Rhew of February 8th, I was told that Susannah has an adult with her at all times, and data is being collected for further review. I have heard otherwise, and would like to discuss this.  But first it should be understood that I suggested to Dr. Rhew that assigning Ms. Shram (or anyone else) to be Susannah’s guardian was a disservice to every other child in the class.  

Dr. Rhew invoked the concept of “equity based on need.” Such strategies may work when a class population fits an approximately Gaussian distribution for behavior and needs, but like any curve, it breaks when even one student occupies a locus well outside that distribution. 

“Equity based on need” in the Burnham kindergarten is now nothing more than **under-serving the class in order to protect them from Susannah**. Not only is this contrary to the principles of public education and the Burnham school charter, but it is too late. Of the 3 other girls in Burnham kindergarten, Xil was the only one who has been consistenly warm, kind, and a wonderful friend to our daughter. **The failure to ensure an “equity based on need” that acknowledges the needs of students like Xil, ultimately failed so severely that a child was bullied out of Burnham KINDERGARTEN.**

Susannah’s parents knowingly falsified their application for Susannah’s admission to Burnham. They know she has needs that aren’t being met. The results of that lie have so far forced one child to flee, taken resources (attention from other teachers and assistants) away from the other students, and left our daughter alone with two girls who both have long-standing patterns of misconduct, which- by all rights- should have already been investigated and subject to redirection. **It is equally important to acknowledge the severity of this disservice to Susannah herself.** 

We are here today to determine accountability- who is responsible for directing the processes necessary to ensure that ALL children are attended to, and that “equity based on need” is taken out of the rules of oversight if it is only of relevance to one student who is violent, aggressive, a bully, and 7 years old. Furthermore, with a clear delineation of accountability, responsibility, and obligation, we want to know more about the plan described to me as actively in motion- we understand that there is information to which we are not entitled (and shouldn’t be, in order to protect the children involved), but there is nevertheless information you are obliged to provide, which is not implicitly protected and which you do not have the right to hide.
